# About

*Javascript vectors benchmark*

Two environment are tested: a web browser and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).


## Installation (node)

The more convenient way is to install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), follow the website instructions.

To install a specific version of node (e.g ``` v12.22.12 ```) run ``` nvm install v12.22.12 ```.

To switch to another installed version run for example ``` nvm use v18.14.2 ```.

To see the list of all installed node versions: ``` nvm ls ```.

To check the currently used version of node: ``` node -v ```.


## Usage

For running the benchmark in a web browser, open the ``` index.html ``` file in said web browser.

*Note: tested on Mozilla Firefox 109.0 64-bit (Ubuntu).*

For testing with node, select the desired node version and run ``` node bench_node.js ```
